The first assignment focuses on online campaign evaluation. It covers topics such as A/B testing, validation of randomization checks for control and treatment groups, calculation of standard error and confidence intervals. Additionally, we compare the effectiveness of Treatment on Treated (TOT) estimates with Intention-to-Treat (ITT) estimates for different control and treatment groups.

The second assignment deals with experimental Power Calculation, aiding us in determining the optimal sample size for each experimental situation.

The last assignment involves the analysis of attribution models used in various channels. We present our analysis based on different touchpoints. For each question in this assignment, we compare revenue generated by different attribution models (Last-touch model, First-touch model, Linear attribution model) to identify the best-performing one.
